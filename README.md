An innovative approach for infant monitoring system using pulse rate and oxygen level

Abstract:
Monitoring health parameters of newborns such as respiration patterns, oxygen level, sleep activity etc. is necessary to ensure salubriousness of their health. A conventional approach does not efficiently provide the real time updates of these baby health parameters. Also, there approach requires parents to constantly monitor the parameters of baby to ensure their health. As both parents now days, work outside and it is not always possible to monitor the baby in-person, it is necessary to make use of modern technologies.
It will be beneficial for the parents to readily track health of the infant and getting updates in the unfavorable conditions. Also, in such conditions, parents are equipped with the suggestions of the information about which preventive measures should be taken at the time.
To detect any unfavorable condition of the baby, the monitoring parameters are compared with the normal or under control parameters. Whenever parameter rises above the threshold, parents are informed.
